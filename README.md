<h3>Security</h3><br>
Unibuddy prioritizes the security and privacy of its users. Our implementation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates ensures encrypted communication between your device and our servers. This encryption safeguards sensitive data, providing a secure environment for all interactions on Unibuddy.<br>
<h3>Business Feature (Important)</h3><br>
Since our audience is narrow (only students from one university), our main monetization from the project is advertising integrations with different companies. We will provide advertising services:<br>
1) Advertising service for local businesses (near the university or hostel): coffee shops, restaurants<br>
2) Advertising service for businesses in the service sector: fitness rooms, coworking spaces, etc.<br>
3) cooperation with electronics stores (necessary electronics for students)<br>
4) promotion of various vacancies and internships<br>
The main task of advertising: attracting clients from our university for partner businesses.<br>
And also, we have conditions for cooperation: these goods/services sold should not cause harm/negative effects for the students themselves. We strictly do not advertise: nightlife, alcohol/tobacco products, gaming clubs, unethical products, financial products (loans, credits), vacancies that are absolutely not related to our specialty at the university.<br>
